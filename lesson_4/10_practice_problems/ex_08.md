# Practice Problem 8

## Question 1

What would be output by this code?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.shift(1)
end
```

* First iteration:
  * `number = 1` therefore `1` is printed
  * `numbers.shift(1)` removes the first element of `numbers` (`1`)
  * `numbers` is now equal to `[2, 3, 4]`

* Second iteration:
  * The block evaluates the second element of the array `numbers` therefore
    `number = 3`
  * `3` is printed
  * `numbers.shift(1)` removes the first element of `numbers` (`2`)
  * `numbers` is now equal to `[3, 4]`

* There is no third iteration because `each` is looking for `numbers[2]` and
cannot find any value.

Therefore, this program outputs `1` then `3`, and `numbers` is now equal to
`[3, 4]`.

## Question 2

What would be output by this code?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end
```

* First iteration:
  * `number = 1` therefore `1` is printed
  * `numbers.pop(1)` removes the last element from the array (`4`)
  * `numbers` is now equal to `[1, 2, 3]`

* Second iteration:
  * `numbers = 2` therefore `2` is printed
  * `numbers.pop(1)` removes the last element from the array (`3`)
  * `numbers` is now equal to `[1, 2]`

* There is no third iteration because `each` is looking for `numbers[2]` and
cannot find any value.

Therefore, the program outputs `1` then `2`, and `number` is now equal to
`[1, 2]`.
