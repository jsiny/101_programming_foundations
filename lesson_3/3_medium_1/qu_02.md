# Question 2

The result of the following statement will be an error:

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
=> TypeError: no implicit conversion of Integer into String
```


The reason is that we're trying here to print an Integer (`40 + 2`)
without first converting it to a String.

There are two ways to solve this issue :

* Convert this integer to a string using the `to_s` method:

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
```

* Interpolate this integer into the string:

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{(40 + 2)}"
```

Both expressions will print `the value of 40 + 2 is 42`.
